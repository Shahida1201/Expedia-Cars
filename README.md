# xpedia-Cars
The project is a React.js page similar to Expedia Cars where users can search for car rentals using hardcoded data for locations, dates, and options. It includes a search form, filters and results display. The page will be fully responsive on iOS and Android deployed for review, and version-controlled on GitHub.
